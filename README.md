### Rationale
Semantic Release Kotlin is inspired by the [semantic release project](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

I wanted to try out semantic release workflows without introducing node/npm into my project.
Also I wanted to learn Kotlin.

The categories are the same as in the semantic release project.
The keywords that can be used are slightly different to improve commit message readability. 
 

### Usage?
#### Background

#### As library
#### As standalone application
- jar vs binary
